# Demo Restaurant Menu App

The goal of this project is to enhance the customer experience when ordering food at a restaurant. 
This is achieved through a simple web application built with React.js, enabling users to browse a restaurant menu. 
Additionally, users can filter and narrow down items based on various criteria, enhancing their ability to find the dishes they desire.

## Features

- View a list of menu items with details such as name, description, price, and category.
- Filter menu items by category, food type, price, and sale status.
- Search for menu items by name.
- Click on an item to see more details in an overlay.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.

## How to Use

1. Visit the live demo (https://hkim399.github.io/menu-demo/).
2. Explore the menu items displayed on the page.
3. Use the filter buttons to refine the displayed menu items based on your preferences. Every filter section will narrow down your choices.
4. Enter a search term in the search bar to find specific menu items by name.
5. Click on a menu item to view additional details in an overlay.
6. Enjoy exploring the restaurant menu!


## Technologies Used

- React.js
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript

## Database Used
-  A static dataset comprises a manually created array of JavaScript objects.
- The images are free stock photos.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this web app originated from my time working as a server in a restaurant. Seeing firsthand the various customer preferences, allergies, and budget limitations, I envisioned a solution to simplify their search process.

## Future Goal

There are multiple steps to my goal, and here's what I want to achieve:

1. The first goal is to transform this into a full-stack application where restaurant owners can sign into their accounts and edit/add menu items.

- Develop a more user-friendly and intuitive interface that enables customers to navigate easily through the menu.
- Design a visually appealing website using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material UI.
- Implement responsive design to ensure the website is accessible from any device with internet access (while acknowledging it is already responsive, improvements can be made).
- Deploy the application on platform like Vercel for universal accessibility.
- Implement user authentication, either through email sign up/log in via Firebase Auth, Google OAuth, or Amazon Web Services.
- Enable the addition of new menu items or modifications to existing ones through a backend system (e.g., Node.js + Express) and develop an additional site for owners to log in and manage the menu by adding, removing, or editing items.

2. The second goal is to incorporate a cart system that facilitates ordering and payment, akin to other restaurants.

- Integrate a payment system to allow customers to place online orders without needing to physically visit the restaurant.
- Implement a secure payment system, possibly using Stripe, to enable safe transactions.
- Establish an email system for sending confirmation emails after orders are placed, including the estimated time of pick-up.
- Create user accounts for customers to save their previously ordered dishes.
